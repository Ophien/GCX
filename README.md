This project regarded one of my volunteer internships at the Institute of Exact Sciences and Informatics from the Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais.

Its main objective was to help students to test their code, and compilers, created during the Compilers course from the Computer Science department. It was developed in C++ and OpenGL, and it allows to execute compiled code step by step, displaying the instruction being performed by the computer at each step. Moreover, it was also used to evaluate how well the students went when creating their compilers.
